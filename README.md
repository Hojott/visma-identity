# visma-identity
visma-identity module has the URL parser, that's the main attraction. Client has a small draft of a class that can be used to print from uri.

I understood the task as a uri parser, and so wrote a pretty simple class for it. I chose Python because of my familiarity with it. I could've used more functions inside the class, but I was pretty limited with time. I also couldn't really think of an idea for the client for a long time, and it went through many iterations.

The hardest part was definetly finding the time for the project, it came at a really bad time. Also the client was a challenge, it took about half the time and isn't even really good.

I could improve the main class by adding more functionalities, like validating uris or implemeting a display.
